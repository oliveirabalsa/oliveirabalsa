### Hi there, my name is Leonardo ðŸ‘‹

I am a lover of technology, since I love these subjects that involve computer science and programming, learning about these subjects for me is something that does not become a duty, but a fun. I always try to be in constant learning, technology never stops changing and we need to change with it.

I've worked as an electronics, computer support, programming teacher and today I'm finally a software developer and my focus (for now) is the javascript language and its technologies.

- ðŸŒŽ I'm from SÃ£o Paulo, SP - Brazil
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with Node.js and React.js...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kubernetes, AWS and Clean Architecture
